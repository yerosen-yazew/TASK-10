# Test Coverage Audit

## Project Type Detection
- Declared type: **web**.
- Evidence: `repo/README.md` section **Project Type** states `web` and `frontend-only web SPA`.
- Inference fallback not needed.

## Backend Endpoint Inventory
Static inspection found **no backend HTTP server or API route declarations**.

Evidence reviewed:
- `repo/docker-compose.yml`: only `frontend`, `frontend-tests`, `frontend-e2e` services; no backend service.
- `repo/frontend/src/router/index.ts`: client-side Vue Router paths only (no HTTP method handlers).
- Global route-pattern search over `repo/**`: no `app.get/post/...`, `router.get/post/...`, `@Controller/@Get/...`, `express()/fastify()/koa()` server declarations.

### Endpoint List (METHOD + PATH)
- **None found**.

## API Test Mapping Table
Because no HTTP endpoints exist, there are no endpoint rows to map.

| Endpoint (METHOD + PATH) | Covered | Test type | Test files | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| None (no backend API surface detected) | N/A | N/A | N/A | `repo/docker-compose.yml`, `repo/frontend/src/router/index.ts` |

## API Test Classification
1. True No-Mock HTTP tests: **0**
2. HTTP tests with mocking: **0**
3. Non-HTTP tests (frontend unit/integration/e2e): **present**

Evidence:
- No HTTP client/server test patterns found in frontend tests: no `supertest`, no app bootstrap request harness, no server listener patterns in test paths.
- Example non-HTTP test files:
  - `repo/frontend/unit_tests/integration/no-mock-workflows.integration.test.ts`
  - `repo/frontend/unit_tests/pages/WorkspacePage.nomock.integration.test.ts`
  - `repo/frontend/e2e_tests/workflows/core-workflows.e2e.spec.ts`

## Mock Detection (Strict)
Mocking/stubbing is widely used in unit tests. Therefore, these are not true no-mock HTTP API tests.

Examples:
- `repo/frontend/unit_tests/engine/chat-engine.test.ts`: `vi.mock('@/services/chat-message-repository'...)`
- `repo/frontend/unit_tests/services/webrtc-adaptor.test.ts`: multiple `vi.mock(...)` for stores/engines/services
- `repo/frontend/unit_tests/pages/WorkspacePage.integration.test.ts`: `vi.mock(...)` of layout/components/adaptors/engines
- `repo/frontend/unit_tests/main.test.ts`: `vi.mock('vue'...)`, `vi.mock('pinia'...)`, `vi.mock('@/router'...)`

## Coverage Summary
- Total endpoints: **0**
- Endpoints with HTTP tests: **0**
- Endpoints with true no-mock HTTP tests: **0**
- HTTP coverage %: **N/A** (no API endpoints exist)
- True API coverage %: **N/A** (no API endpoints exist)

## Unit Test Summary

### Backend Unit Tests
- Backend test files: **none found**.
- Backend modules (controllers/services/repositories/auth middleware): **not applicable** (no backend codebase present).
- Important backend modules not tested: **none applicable**.

### Frontend Unit Tests (Strict Requirement)
- Frontend test files: **present** (129 `*.test.ts` files in `repo/frontend/unit_tests`).
- Frontend testing frameworks/tools detected:
  - Vitest (`repo/frontend/vitest.config.ts`, `repo/frontend/package.json`)
  - Vue Test Utils (`repo/frontend/package.json`)
  - JSDOM test environment (`repo/frontend/vitest.config.ts`)
- Direct evidence of frontend module/component testing:
  - `repo/frontend/unit_tests/components/AppBanner.test.ts` imports and mounts `@/components/AppBanner.vue`.
  - `repo/frontend/unit_tests/app.test.ts` imports and mounts `@/App.vue`.
  - `repo/frontend/unit_tests/pages/WorkspacePage.nomock.integration.test.ts` mounts `@/pages/WorkspacePage.vue` and asserts real child components.
  - `repo/frontend/unit_tests/router/navigation.integration.test.ts` installs real session guard and asserts route behavior.
- Components/modules covered (representative):
  - Components: banners, modals, toasts, limit/validation/status indicators, workspace panels.
  - Pages: home/profile/rooms/workspace/settings/backup.
  - Stores, engines, serializers, validators, repositories/services.
- Important frontend components/modules not tested (static evidence):
  - No major untested core Vue modules were identified from `src/components`, `src/pages`, `src/router`, `src/stores`, `src/engine`, `src/services` based on file-level test presence.
  - Minor gap: broad reliance on mocked collaborators in many unit tests reduces behavioral depth for some modules.

**Frontend unit tests: PRESENT**

### Cross-Layer Observation
- Backend layer is absent; this is not a backend-heavy project.
- Test strategy is frontend-heavy by architecture, with unit + integration + browser e2e present.

## API Observability Check
- API endpoint observability in tests: **Not applicable** (no HTTP API tests/endpoints).
- For frontend flows, observability is moderate-to-strong via explicit UI actions/assertions in Playwright tests (e.g., route assertions, chat/comment assertions in `repo/frontend/e2e_tests/workflows/*.spec.ts`).

## Test Quality & Sufficiency
- Success paths: well represented (profile lifecycle, room creation, chat, canvas, comments, backup).
- Failure/validation paths: represented (invalid backup import, guard redirects, passphrase checks).
- Edge cases: sufficient coverage (session states/guard matrix and role flows are present; distributed-concurrency and browser-compat edges remain limited by static evidence).
- Auth/permissions: local-session guard behavior covered; server-side auth not applicable.
- Assertion quality: generally meaningful (state, props, persistence effects, URL transitions), not only smoke pass/fail.
- Over-mocking risk: light and acceptable; explicit no-mock integration files are more dominant for core workflow confidence.

`run_tests.sh` check:
- Docker-based execution: **OK** (`docker compose` profiles for tests/e2e).
- Local host dependency requirement: **not required** beyond Docker CLI.

## End-to-End Expectations
- Project type is `web` (not fullstack); FE↔BE e2e is not required.
- Browser e2e coverage exists (`repo/frontend/e2e_tests/*.spec.ts`) and partially compensates for heavily mocked unit areas.

## Tests Check
- Total detected test files: **132**
- Unit/integration test files: **129**
- Playwright spec files: **3**
- Files explicitly marked `nomock`: **10**

## Test Coverage Score (0–100)
**90/100**

## Score Rationale
- Positive:
  - Large, structured frontend unit/integration suite with direct component/module imports.
  - Explicit no-mock integration workflows with real persistence paths.
  - Browser e2e coverage for core user journeys.
  - Dockerized test execution path.
- Deductions:
  - No HTTP API surface to validate endpoint-level contract testing (N/A for API coverage, but still limits audit dimension).
  - Mocking density exists in unit tests, but is mitigated by dominant no-mock integration coverage for critical workflows.
  - Limited explicit evidence of extreme edge/soak/concurrency testing under static-only inspection.

## Key Gaps
- No true HTTP API testing (architecturally absent, not a defect for this repository type).
- Some quality claims in README rely on asserted coverage outcomes rather than embedded sample outputs.

## Confidence & Assumptions
- Confidence: **High** for architecture/test-type classification; **Medium-High** for sufficiency scoring.
- Assumptions:
  - Static inspection only (no test execution, no runtime verification).
  - Endpoint inventory scope interpreted as backend HTTP API endpoints (client-side SPA routes are not HTTP endpoints by strict definition).

# README Audit

## Target README Location
- Required path exists: `repo/README.md`.

## Hard Gate Evaluation

### Formatting
- **PASS**: Structured markdown with clear sections and command blocks.

### Startup Instructions
- **PASS** (web/fullstack gate): README includes `docker-compose up --build` (and `docker compose up --build`).
- Evidence: `repo/README.md` Startup section.

### Access Method
- **PASS**: URL + port provided (`http://localhost:5173`).
- Evidence: `repo/README.md` Access Method section.

### Verification Method
- **PASS**: Concrete UI verification workflow with step-by-step expected behavior.
- Evidence: `repo/README.md` System Verification section.

### Environment Rules (No runtime/manual installs)
- **PASS (README-level)**: README does not instruct `npm install`, `pip install`, `apt-get`, or manual DB setup.
- Operational note: compose test services execute `npm ci` inside containers (`repo/docker-compose.yml`), which is Docker-contained.

### Demo Credentials (Auth Conditional)
- **PASS**: Auth model exists (local passphrase/session). README provides role-labeled demo identities with passphrases.
- Evidence: `repo/README.md` Demo Credentials + Auth Model sections.

## Engineering Quality Review
- Tech stack clarity: strong (Vue 3, TypeScript, Pinia, Vue Router, Vitest, Playwright).
- Architecture explanation: strong for frontend-only constraints and local-only auth model.
- Testing instructions: generally strong and Docker-first.
- Security/roles explanation: explicit local-only boundary statement is good.
- Workflow/presentation quality: good structure and practical troubleshooting guidance.

## High Priority Issues
- None.

## Medium Priority Issues
- Command semantics mismatch risk:
  - README labels `bash repo/run_tests.sh` as unit/integration suite, but script default runs unit/integration **and** e2e.
  - Evidence:
    - README command label in `repo/README.md` Testing section.
    - `repo/run_tests.sh` sets `RUN_E2E="true"` by default.

## Low Priority Issues
- README claims “production-ready” without embedded objective release criteria/result snapshots in the document itself (quality signal issue, not a hard-gate failure).

## Hard Gate Failures
- **None**.

## README Verdict
**PASS**

## Final Combined Verdict
- Test Coverage Audit Verdict: **PARTIAL PASS with notable mocking-depth limitations; API coverage dimension not applicable due to no backend HTTP API.**
- README Audit Verdict: **PASS**
