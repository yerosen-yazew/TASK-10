# Delivery Acceptance Follow-up: Fresh Fix Check
## ForgeRoom Offline Collaboration Workspace — Independent Static Reassessment

Date: 2026-04-17
Review mode: Static source and unit test inspection only. No runtime execution, no Docker usage, no test execution.

---

## 1) Final Status

Independent re-review result: most reported issues are fixed.

Summary:
- Fixed: 5
- Partially fixed: 0
- Unchanged and non-blocking: 0

The prior High blocker about rollback not restoring live room state is fixed in implementation and specifically covered by updated tests.

## 2) Detailed Recheck Against Prior Findings

### F-01 High: Rollback did not restore live workspace state
Status: Fixed

Current code behavior:
- rollbackTo now clears and repopulates live repositories for elements, chat messages, pinned messages, comment threads, and comments from the selected source snapshot.
- snapshot store rollback then reloads element, chat, and comment stores so UI data refreshes.

Evidence:
- repo/frontend/src/engine/snapshot-engine.ts:122
- repo/frontend/src/engine/snapshot-engine.ts:126
- repo/frontend/src/engine/snapshot-engine.ts:130
- repo/frontend/src/engine/snapshot-engine.ts:134
- repo/frontend/src/engine/snapshot-engine.ts:138
- repo/frontend/src/stores/snapshot-store.ts:76
- repo/frontend/src/stores/snapshot-store.ts:77
- repo/frontend/src/stores/snapshot-store.ts:78

Test confirmation:
- repo/frontend/unit_tests/engine/snapshot-engine.test.ts:184
- repo/frontend/unit_tests/stores/snapshot-store.test.ts:145

Conclusion:
- Original High defect is resolved by static evidence.

---

### Medium: Workspace toolbar snapshots and members shortcuts were no-ops
Status: Fixed

Current code behavior:
- Toolbar events now invoke openPanel on WorkspaceLayout for snapshots and members.

Evidence:
- repo/frontend/src/pages/WorkspacePage.vue:258
- repo/frontend/src/pages/WorkspacePage.vue:259

Test confirmation:
- repo/frontend/unit_tests/pages/WorkspacePage.test.ts:311
- repo/frontend/unit_tests/pages/WorkspacePage.test.ts:318

---

### Low: Awaiting approval page had no auto-update path
Status: Fixed

Current code behavior:
- RoomJoinPage subscribes to membership-change events and navigates to workspace when an approve event targets the active profile.
- Awaiting text now explicitly states automatic redirect.

Evidence:
- repo/frontend/src/pages/RoomJoinPage.vue:102
- repo/frontend/src/pages/RoomJoinPage.vue:106
- repo/frontend/src/pages/RoomJoinPage.vue:206

Test confirmation:
- repo/frontend/unit_tests/pages/RoomJoinPage.test.ts:180

---

### Low: Autosave heartbeat was a no-op and not failure-aware
Status: Fixed

Current code behavior:
- onAutoSave now performs an IndexedDB health check via elementRepository.countByRoom.
- It sets failed on health-check exceptions or when element/chat/comment stores hold errors.
- It sets saved only when those checks pass.

Evidence:
- repo/frontend/src/pages/WorkspacePage.vue:182
- repo/frontend/src/pages/WorkspacePage.vue:188

Test confirmation:
- repo/frontend/unit_tests/pages/WorkspacePage.test.ts:360
- repo/frontend/unit_tests/pages/WorkspacePage.test.ts:368
- repo/frontend/unit_tests/pages/WorkspacePage.test.ts:376

Residual note:
- Autosave now has explicit health checks and failure handling at the scheduler boundary.

---

### Low: QR scan camera placeholder flow
Status: Fixed

Current code behavior:
- No scan button and no camera-request placeholder flow in RoomJoinPage.
- Unit test confirms scan button is not rendered.

Evidence:
- repo/frontend/src/pages/RoomJoinPage.vue
- repo/frontend/unit_tests/pages/RoomJoinPage.test.ts:225

4. Autosave accuracy coverage
- Fixed
- Evidence: repo/frontend/unit_tests/pages/WorkspacePage.test.ts:360
- Evidence: repo/frontend/unit_tests/pages/WorkspacePage.test.ts:368
- Evidence: repo/frontend/unit_tests/pages/WorkspacePage.test.ts:376

5. QR placeholder UX coverage

## 4) Independent Final Conclusion

Compared to the original audit, the acceptance posture has improved substantially. The former High blocker is resolved and protected by tests. Medium and low findings in this follow-up are resolved by current static code and test evidence.
